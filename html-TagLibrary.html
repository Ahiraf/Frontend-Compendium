        <p>Today I will talk about a movie I recently watched, and that is <i>"Moana 2"</i>.<br>
            I enjoyed this movie so much, and at the same time, I was excited to see it because it was the first movie I watched in a cineplex.
            
            My friend Simin was with me, and we bought two popcorns.
            As it was a 3D movie, I was amazed to see itâ€”it felt like I was inside the movie, standing right beside Moana.
            
            Every scene of the ocean and the night sky, filled with stars and celestial objects, made me feel so good. At first, I was very nervous because of the sound. The volume was very high, and I had never experienced such loud sounds before. But soon, I adapted to it.
            
            All the songs in this movie were wonderful, and among them, I loved the song <i>"Beyond"</i> the most.
            I will always remember that day.
